# shittyPong
It's like pong but it was made by a guy who didn't really know what he was doing
Oh wait. That's what it is

I made this a while ago as part of my uni course.
You control the left paddle with 'W' for up and 'S' for down
The right paddle was controlled by some maths that I didn't work out, credit to Maria.
Have fun
